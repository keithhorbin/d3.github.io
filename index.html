                    <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health and Poverty Levels</h2>
					<h3>Poverty vs.</h3>
                    <p>As poverty increases, there is a directly realted increase with Obesity, Smoking, and Insurance Coverage. Meaning as the poverty percent increases the same happens with this categories.
                        These increases suggest that the accessability of smarter food choices (possibly driven by food deserts) and healthcare in impoverished areas is limited or atleast the purchasing power is diverted to
                        things that bring comfort (less nutrious food, smoking) more so than health.
                    </p>
					<h3>Age vs.</h3>
					<p>Age provides some less obvious correlations with the exception that younger median age groups tend to be lower percents in terms
                        of smoking. Otherwise there is less to glean from the sample set on obesity and insurance coverage. Curious if further analysis could be done on regionality of the states
                        or other cultural impacts drive these numbers. 
					</p>
					<h3>Income vs.</h3>
					<p>Income, like poverty, has a fairly distinct relationship with Obesity, Smoking, and Insurance Coverage. As income increases
                        we see that the percent of each group moves indirectly as income increases. Decreases in these numbers suggest that added income allows for better food choices, access to care, and
                        possibly better education as to the harms of smoking.
